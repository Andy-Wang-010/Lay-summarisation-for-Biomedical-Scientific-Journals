paradoxus and its sibling species S . cerevisiae to investigate the hybrid reactivation hypothesis and , more generally , the factors governing TE accumulation in natural and experimental lineages .', 'Rather , we show that deterministic factors like population structure and the properties of individual hybrid genotypes are major determinants of TE content evolution in hybrid genomes .', 'Based on the assembly annotations , Ty1 was the most abundant family and exhibited the largest CN variation among lineages , with a striking difference between SpB and SpC ( Figure 2c ) .', 'We thus explored the evolutionary dynamics of Ty families within each genome .', 'Overall , this result indicated that CN variation reflected variation in family dynamics and confirmed that Ty elements exhibited no reactivation in hybrid lineages .', 'Next , we tested whether orthology between genome-wide Ty insertion loci was consistent with transposition activity .', 'This contrasted with the assumption that TE abundances can be interpreted as equilibrium CNs under the transposition-selection balance hypothesis ( Charlesworth and Charlesworth , 1983 ) and rather suggested a recent transposition rate increase in SpC-related lineages .', 'Our results showed that hybrid lineages exhibited no outstanding Ty CN profiles or sequence dynamics .', 'To exclude this possibility , we investigated which factors best explain the variation in Ty CN in natural lineages .', 'Finally , the efficiency at which natural selection purges deleterious Ty insertions ( which depends on Ne ) could vary between lineages , ultimately affecting the transposition-selection balance .', 'However , hybrid lineages were represented by relatively few strains ( ≤10 in each case ) , which made it hard to reach meaningful conclusions for some analyses .', 'While pure lineages did exhibit variation in πS ( Supplementary file 1c ) , there was no obvious negative relationship between Ty CNs and πS ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) , as would be expected under a transposition-selection equilibrium ( assuming negligible variation in mutation rate ) .', 'The absence of ORF-disrupting Ty insertions in hybrid lineages and their scarcity in pure lineages suggest that natural selection is globally very efficient at purging these mutations .', 'This phenotype was generalized to the whole lineages , and while LL2011_004 was in the lower part of the SpC distribution , it was not significantly different from many SpC strains not harboring an insertion ( Figure 5b , Figure 5—figure supplement 9 ) .', 'Overall , these results show that variation in natural selection efficiency is unlikely to explain a large part of the variation in Ty CNs in natural lineages .', 'Thus far , our results showed that no reactivation is apparent in natural hybrid lineages , that population structure over environmental variables best explains variation in Ty CNs and that natural selection efficiency is unlikely to explain much variation in Ty genomic landscapes .', 'Thus , it can be expected that incompatibilities affecting transposition rates are more likely to be observed in hybrids between highly diverged genotypes compared to closely related ones .', 'Some of the contrasted dynamics between crosses that share high genetic similarity might originate from cryptic genetic variation in genes involved in Ty regulation , whose effect on transposition rate would be uncovered in hybrids .', 'TEs are structurally very diverse and populate the genomes of a vast range\\xa0of\\xa0species , and the control mechanisms in response to their mobilization may exhibit a correspondingly large diversity .', 'In particular , our data suggests a negative relationship between the initial Ty1 CN in hybrid genotypes

distal-posterior limb region .', 'Even though Shh was not expressed in the anterior region of the limb bud , the H3K4me1 mark was enriched in both dissected halves suggesting that the ZRS was poised across the distal compartment of the limb .', 'The ZRS encompasses two distinct regulatory activities; one residing in the 5’ half driving spatiotemporal expression and one residing in the 3’ half mediating long-range activation of the Shh gene ( Lettice et al . , 2014 ) ( Figure 1C ) .', 'H3K27ac was , therefore , associated with the distal , posterior quadrant of the limb bud consistent with the presence of the ZPA where the Shh gene is transcriptionally active ( Figure 1A ) .', 'To further investigate Shh activation in the cell line , we carried out a TSA time course to assay H3K27ac
